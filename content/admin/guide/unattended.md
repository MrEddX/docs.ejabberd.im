# Unattended Installation

Bitrock framework allow unattended installation. With this mode, the
installer will not prompt the user for any information and will
instead use the default settings configured for each of the
parameters. That way, no input is required from the user during the
installation. It's also possible to define the values through command
line or using a configuration file

``` sh
./sample-installer.bin --mode unattended --param1 value1 --param2 value2 ....
./sample-installer.bin --mode unattended --optionfile optionfile
```

Where optionfile should contain a list of pairs key=value. For instance:

``` sh
param1=value1
param2=value2
```
