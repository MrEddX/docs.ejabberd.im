# Upgrade to ejabberd 17.09

You should follow this procedure if you are upgrading from ejabberd 17.06, 17.07
or 17.08.

## ejabberdctl script

Due to a major refactor of the ejabberdctl script, you should check your
packaging and your system's version of ejabberdctl script.
While old script still works, you are encouraged to use the new one.
This may depends on media you install ejabberd from.
