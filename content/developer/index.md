# ejabberd for Developers

As a developer, you can customize ejabberd to design almost every type of XMPP related type of solutions.

As a starting point, we recommend that you get extremely familiar with both the core XMPP protocol itself and its extensions.

From that, once you understand well XMPP, you can tame ejabberd to build your dream messaging system.

## Getting started

### Source code

ejabberd source is available on Github: [ejabberd](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd)

You will need to get familiar with it to start learning about ejabberd
module writing. The first place to start? You should read the
[time module](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd/blob/master/src/mod_time.erl). This
is one of the simplest possible module for ejabberd.

Another great source of inspiration and knowledge is to read the
source code of the many contributed ejabberd modules. Many of them are
available from
[ejabberd-contribs](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd-contrib)
repository.

For a complete overview of ejabberd source code and its dependencies, please refer to [ejabberd and related repositories](./repositories.md)
